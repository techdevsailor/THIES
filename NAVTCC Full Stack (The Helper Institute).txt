Client  (posting request) to Server (which serves)
Server respond to client

Client IP (like 169.232.116.21) address contact with servers IP Address

Web development: showing something on WWW
Devloper: write code (front end & Back end)

--------------frontend-----------------(HTML,CSS,Js, React, --- another also Angular.js, Next.js)

HTML: Hyper text markup language (Structured languages) (skull of the website) (high browsers compatibility)

Hyper text:Navigate to other page
Markup:

Tag: </>, <p><p/>

CSS: Style sheet

JavaScript: Functions of website

DOM: Documen Object Model

HTML Tags: Read and practices different Tags (Table, Br, header, etc)
Assignement: 


--JavaScript:
Js is a dynamic language
Ecma Script ES6
loosly type language
Single threaded language

# 7 data types (premitives)
string	textual form a b c etc
numbers	123
boolean	true false
float	1.2   56.4 (decimal)
bigint	large amount 100000000
Null	intentionaly left blank during defining veriable
undefined	not defined, not assign value

#Non premitives data types
objects	
arrays	all kind of data like floar, string etc
functions


all premitive data type stored in Stacks (Memory types), also called call by values
all premitive data type stored in Heap (Memory types), also called call by references


functions syntax:
function Myapp(){}

# Array methods
	



# String methods
	.charAt			//finding characters with index number
	.charCodeAt		
	.trim			//remove leading and trailing whitespaces from both ends (start and last)
	.touppercase		//convert to uppercase letters
	.tolowercase		//convert to lowercase letters
	.substring		//specified part of the string between start and end indexes i.e between index 0 and 5
	.startwith		//check if message starts with any word
	.endswith		//check if message ends with any word
	.length			//check length of string
	.repeat			//repeating the given string 3 times
many more methods are available online


# conditional statement: (if/else, switch/case/break)
Any value that is not defined as falsy would be considered truthy in JavaScript.
There are times in JavaScript where you might consider using a switch statement instead of an if else statement.

Note: all example of code available in function.js file



  
  console.log(testNum(-5));


# Artimatic operator

+,-, /, * etc

# conditional operators
>, <, =< , !=, etc




# Loops:

3 types of loops (for loop, while loop, do while loop)

# Synchronous and Asynchronous
Synchronous(block begaviour)(one by one like single thread) Every task make saperate thread 


Asynchronous (Multi thread type) if one task takes time it shift to next task However, thread same remains Task simultaneously

There are diff function to make Synchronous to Asynchronous i.e callback, promises ( i.e .then, .fetch), Async/Await

Callback: Technique allows a function to call another functionfunctions are executed in the sequence they are called. Not in the sequence they are defined.
Callback hell: when we call function into function

Promises: A Promise contains both the producing code and calls to the consuming code
Promise are available after callback
Promises has 3 states (Pending, success, failure)

Settimeout is a parameter and required 2 values (function and parameter)
Async/Await:




#Objects
syntax available in functions.js file
Object methods/ assign
	Object.assign		//to merge objects
	.freeze			//to freez an object
	.key			//used to retrieve an array of the enumerable property names of an object


this keyword is used to access object proporty mostly    (i.e this.)

#Getter & Setter
getName() & Setname are not a funtion (only getter property)

getter methods are used to access the properties of an object
setter methods are used to change the values of an object

Module in Node.js serves as a functionality organized that is associated with multiple JavaScript files. Each module in Node.js comes with its context to stop interfering with other modules or polluting the global scope.
